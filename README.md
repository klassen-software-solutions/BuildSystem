# BuildSystem
Build system utilities used for all KSS projects

The purpose of this project is to contain the utilities common to all Klassen Software Solutions
build systems.

## Usage

The utilities are divided into language groups based on a directory, with `common` being utilities that
are independant of the source language. Within each language group is a separate README.md that
describes how a project should make use of its utilities.
